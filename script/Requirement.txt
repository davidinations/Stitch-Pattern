Step Steps To Build Image Classification Model:
1) Datasets.  
2) Convert Datasets Into Vector.
   - Image Preprocessing. (Resize, Normalize, Etc.)
   - Pattern Detector. (Use OpenCV Model Which Is Not Accurate Or Build Custom Model With Pytorch, Tensorflow, PictoBlox, Etc)
   - Embeddings Model. (Resnet, VGG, Inception, Or Already Model)
3) Find Algorithm That Fit The Goals And Data. (Classification Algorithm That Can Detect Image Pattern)
4) Simulate The Result To See The Algorithm Is Good Enough Or Not. (Look At TestAlgorithm.ipynb)
5) Implement User Interface With Export Backend Python Script.
